# Malware_Detection
In the given data set we have .bytes file and .asm file.
I have used .bytes file and converted them into a image.
After i have created the Image i used cnn to train it for calssification.
In future for this project i will use resnet or vgg16 for architecture (transfer learning) and i will use n-gram model for .asm file. 
For further understanding reffer to "Duc-Ly Vu1, Trong-Kha Nguyen2, Tam V. Nguyen3, Tu N. Nguyen4, Fabio Massacci1, and Phu H. Phung3. (2019) A Convolutional Transformation Network for Malware Classification".
