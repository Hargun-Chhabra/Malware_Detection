# Malware_Detection
This project is based on Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (2015).
In the given data set we have .bytes file and .asm file.
I have used .bytes file and converted them into a image.
After i have created the Image i used cnn to train it for calssification.
In future for this project i will use resnet or vgg16 for architecture (transfer learning) and i will use n-gram model for .asm file.
